Proof of ownership: 

This is entirely our own work.

The idea was to maximize the use of threads by creating a thread for the statistics performed on each link found by the recursive method ,
in a best case scenario there wont be broken links and there wont be lots of redirects to the same page 
the heavy lifiting is done by the visit method which recursivly travesers the web and gets links and adds them to a 
set and that set is then operated on by threads to perform calculations and then finally gather total links and 
total tags through a series of for loops on the final set and prints them in the console. The modularity of the 
program helped make this assignment a little easier however , parsing would have been easier and probably done more 
efficiently if 3rd party libraries were used but since our parsing was failry simple and trivial it was not really 
required .


The proper use of data structures such as ArrayLists and HashSets was cruical to the success of the program.



The code is commented in Javadoc style.
